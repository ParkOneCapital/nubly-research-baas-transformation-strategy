# A BaaS Revolution: Transforming the Financial Landscape

A growing Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) revolution is transforming the financial landscape, enabling small banks and occasionally credit unions to survive and adapt in the digital age. BaaS enables legacy banking providers to collaborate with financial technology companies (fintechs), leveraging the banks' existing licenses to modernize their infrastructure and deliver new banking services in innovative ways.

The following is a model summary detailing a set of assumptions about the modern banking industry. The report gives an overview of the current industry, BaaS and its ability to transform legacy financial insititutions.

## BaaS Revolution and Fintech Evolution

The BaaS revolution is enabled by fintech evolution, which has progressed through three distinct phases:

- Digitalization: Introduced digital channels and online banking services, laying the groundwork for further innovation
- Dis-intermediation: Emerged fintech companies disrupted traditional banking functions, creating opportunities for new partnerships
- Embedded Infrastructure: Enabled BaaS platforms to integrate banking services into non-bank businesses, fostering seamless user experiences

BaaS has become the key approach in this latest phase, empowering small banks and credit unions to expand financial inclusion and reach.

## Partnerships and Innovation

As the BaaS revolution gains momentum, legacy financial institutions are incentivized to partner with fintech companies to:

- Stay competitive in the digital age
- Enhance customer experience through modern user interfaces and AI driven services
- Improve operational efficiency through streamlined processes, compliance and automation

Recent market events highlight the importance of resilient partnerships, pathways for fintechs to own charters, and the need to foster an interconnected fintech ecosystem to ensure robust compliance and scalability.

## Modern Banking Model and Key Success Factors
A community bank or credit union adopting a BaaS-first approach can achieve success by partnering or acquiring and transforming existing financial institutions, such as Column Banks efforts with Northern California Bank. This approach enables the elimination of middleware bloat, streamlining financial application development for partners, and unlocking various revenue streams.
