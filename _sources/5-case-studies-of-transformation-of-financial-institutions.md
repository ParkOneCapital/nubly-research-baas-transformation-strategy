Rationale:

- Rose Community Bank's NIM is expected to improve significantly over the next 5 years due to its successful turnaround and BaaS transformation.
- The bank's focus on expanding its lending portfolio and introducing new deposit products will help improve its NIM.
- However, Rose Community Bank's NIM is expected to remain slightly lower than Golden Goose Community Bank's due to its smaller size and more limited product offerings.

Note: These projections assume that both banks will continue to execute their respective strategies successfully and that market conditions will remain favorable.



### Summary 

The BaaS transformation has improved the financial performance of both banks, with increased assets, deposits, loans, NIM, ROA, and ROE over the 3-year period. 

The BaaS transformation has led to diversification throughtout the banking operations leading to an increase in non-interest income for both banks, with a corresponding decrease in the percentage of net interest income. This indicates a more diversified income stream, with a greater emphasis on fee-based services and other non-interest income sources. Golden Goose Community Bank has seen a significant increase in non-interest income, while Rose Community Bank has turned around its negative metrics and is now showing a healthy mix of net interest and non-interest income.

This shift indicates that Golden Goose Community Bank may have successfully introduced new fee-based services, such as:

* Payment processing
* Wealth management
* Digital banking services


This shift indicates that Rose Community Bank may have successfully introduced new fee-based services, such as:

* Introduced new deposit products
* Expanded its lending portfolio
* Implemented cost-saving measures

By diversifying their income streams, both banks have reduced their reliance on NII and created a more resilient and sustainable business model.

Both banks have undergone significant transformations. Golden Goose Community Bank has seen significant improvements, while Rose Community Bank has turned around its negative metrics and is now showing positive growth. In addition, the banks have diversified their income streams, improved their efficiency ratios, and strengthened their capital adequacy ratios.

The BaaS transformation has significantly improved Electricians United Credit Union's financial performance and operational efficiency over the 3-year period. Key highlights include increases in assets, deposits, loans, and membership, alongside decreases in funding costs and credit risk. Notably, the credit union's Return on Assets (ROA) has more than tripled, indicating substantially improved financial performance.

This transformation was predicated on several key assumptions, including consistent economic growth and stable interest rates. Successful execution of the BaaS transformation and strategic initiatives, improved operational efficiency, and reduced costs were also crucial factors. Furthermore, enhanced credit risk management resulting from diversification and reduced loan losses contributed to the credit union's improved financial position.
