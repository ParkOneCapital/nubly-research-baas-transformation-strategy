# BaaS Transformation Strategy Model Summary

## Nubly Research

The Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) revolution is redefining the financial industry by enabling non-bank entities to offer banking services leveraging licensed banks' digital infrastructure. This paradigm shift, driven by fintech evolution, necessitates deeper strategic partnerships between financial institutions and fintech companies to ensure competitiveness, enhanced customer experience, and operational compliance. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges of BaaS in the context of the overall financial landscape, assumptions about innovation potential and risks. Additionally, this paper aims to examine the strategic rationale for deeper integration of fintechs into banks or credit unions highlighting potential implications of such collaborations. We provide model outputs as case studies to demonstrate the effects of transforming community banks and credit unions of various conditions via a BaaS strategy. Our goal is to explore assumptions about the BaaS strategy to model how legacy financial institutions can modernize their infrastructure, diversify banking books, and adapt to modern customer experiences from deep integration with fintechs.
